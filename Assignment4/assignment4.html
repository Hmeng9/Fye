                        4 Steps to cooking ChickenSatay
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make the marinade. Combine coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry
                                powder, ground
                                coriander, ground ginger, minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in a bowl.</li>
                            <li> Marinate the chicken. Add two pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts to the
                                marinade,
                                toss
                                the chicken in the marinade until it’s well coated. Place in the refrigerator to
                                marinate for 30
                                minutes. This chicken is honestly so flavorful and tender after just a 30 minute
                                marinade, but if
                                you
                                want to make it earlier, you can leave the chicken in the marinade for up to 4 hours.
                            </li>
                            <li>Skewer the chicken. If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes
                                before
                                preparing
                                the skewers. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the grill, pretty
                                important stuff!
                                Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinating liquid. Skewer 4-5
                                pieces of
                                marinated
                                chicken onto skewers. You’ll need 10-12 metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers.</li>
                            <li>Grill the chicken. Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking these skewers quickly over high
                                heat will
                                give
                                them a wonderful sear on the outside, while keeping them juicy and tender in the middle!
                                Place the
                                skewers on the grill over high heat for 3-4 minutes, flip and grill for an additional
                                3-4 minutes.
                                Remove from the grill and top with fresh cilantro, if you’d like.</li>

                        What should I serve with it
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Thai Peanut Sauce – while this is optional, it’s also pretty standard to find chicken
                                satay paired with
                                peanut sauce. They really are a match made in heaven! Lettuce Leaves – chicken satay is
                                delicious served
                                as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a fork to remove the chicken from the skewers and place it
                                right in an
                                iceberg, butter or romaine lettuce leaf. Drizzle with a little peanut sauce and you’ve
                                got a light,
                                healthy meal! Fresh Veggies – as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay with a
                                fresh veggie tray
                                from Vons and extra Thai peanut sauce for dipping the veggies. The chicken and veggie
                                combo was light,
                                yet still filling enough for a meal and it gave me the opportunity to dip two things
                                into that
                                absolutely delicious peanut sauce! Stir Fried Veggies – while the chicken is marinating,
                                you can take
                                that time to stir fry up your favorite veggies, like broccoli, bell peppers, onions and
                                sugar snap peas.
                                Asian Salad – for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian chopped salad in the produce section
                                at your local
                                Vons, to pair with the chicken skewers. Cooked Rice or Quinoa – for a more filling side,
                                serve the
                                chicken satay with a side of cooked white rice, brown rice or quinoa.</li>
